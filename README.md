# Hotel-Reservation-System_Backend
The backend of the Hotel Reservation System is developed using Java and Spring Boot, with data storage managed through MySQL. This component provides a robust foundation for the system's functionality, including secure user authentication, JWT-based authorization, and RESTful APIs for seamless communication with the frontend.

## Key Features:
* __User Authentication and Authorization:__ Utilizes JWT-based authentication for secure user login and logout processes, ensuring data integrity.

* __RESTful APIs:__ Implements a set of RESTful APIs to facilitate communication with the frontend, enabling smooth data flow and real-time updates.

* __Database Management:__ Utilizes MySQL to efficiently store and retrieve hotel information, user details, and reservation data.

* __Scalable Architecture:__ Designed with a modular and scalable architecture to accommodate future enhancements and feature additions.
